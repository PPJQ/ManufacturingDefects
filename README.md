# Introduction

In this project we have data that provides insights into factors influencing defect rates in a manufacturing environment. Our task in this report is to make a Machine Learning model to predict high or low defect occurrences in production processes.

Let's begin with the description of the metrics of the dataset: 

## Variables Description
### Production Metrics
**ProductionVolume**: Number of units produced per day.

Data Type: Integer.

Range: 100 to 1000 units/day.

**ProductionCost**: Cost incurred for production per day.

Data Type: Float.

Range: $5000 to $20000.

### Supply Chain and Logistics
**SupplierQuality**: Quality ratings of suppliers.

Data Type: Float (%).

Range: 80% to 100%.

**DeliveryDelay**: Average delay in delivery.

Data Type: Integer (days).

Range: 0 to 5 days.

### Quality Control and Defect Rates
**DefectRate**: Defects per thousand units produced.

Data Type: Float.

Range: 0.5 to 5.0 defects.

**QualityScore**: Overall quality assessment.

Data Type: Float (%).

Range: 60% to 100%.

### Maintenance and Downtime
**MaintenanceHours**: Hours spent on maintenance per week.

Data Type: Integer.

Range: 0 to 24 hours.

**DowntimePercentage**: Percentage of production downtime.

Data Type: Float (%).

Range: 0% to 5%.

### Inventory Management
**InventoryTurnover**: Ratio of inventory turnover.

Data Type: Float.

Range: 2 to 10.

**StockoutRate**: Rate of inventory stockouts.

Data Type: Float (%).

Range: 0% to 10%.

### Workforce Productivity and Safety
**WorkerProductivity**: Productivity level of the workforce.

Data Type: Float (%).

Range: 80% to 100%.

**SafetyIncidents**: Number of safety incidents per month.

Data Type: Integer.

Range: 0 to 10 incidents.

### Energy Consumption and Efficiency
**EnergyConsumption**: Energy consumed in kWh.

Data Type: Float.

Range: 1000 to 5000 kWh.

**EnergyEfficiency**: Efficiency factor of energy usage.

Data Type: Float.

Range: 0.1 to 0.5.

### Additive Manufacturing
**AdditiveProcessTime**: Time taken for additive manufacturing.

Data Type: Float (hours).

Range: 1 to 10 hours.

**AdditiveMaterialCost**: Cost of additive materials per unit.

Data Type: Float ($).

Range: $100 to $500.

### Target Variable
**DefectStatus**: Predicted defect status.

Data Type: Binary (0 for Low Defects, 1 for High Defects).


# Results of the Analysis
According with the Correlation Matrix:

![Correlation Matrix](./datasets/img/CorrelationMatrix.png)

We can see that target variable `DefectStatus` has a strong correlation with the variables `MaintenanceHours`, `DefectRate` and `ProductionVolume`. If we see the charts of these Variables we notice the following behavior:

![DefectRate chart](./datasets/img/DefectRate-DefectStatus.png)

![ProductionVolume chart](./datasets/img/ProductionVolume-DefectStatus.png)

* The probability of produce more defects in production increase if the production volume is above 800 pieces per day.
* If the maintenance hours per week are above 10 hours, the probability of produce defects in production increase.

# Machine Learning Models

For this project we trained 3 models:

* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest
* Gradient Boosting

And according with the metrics: 

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1 
* ROC_AUC

The results for the models are the following: 

## Logistic Regression

| Accuracy | Precision | Recall |  F1  | ROC_AUC |
|----------|-----------|--------|------|---------|
|   0.75   |    0.93   |  0.75  | 0.83 |   0.84  |

## Random Forest

| Accuracy | Precision | Recall |  F1  | ROC_AUC |
|----------|-----------|--------|------|---------|
|   0.95   |    0.95   |  0.99  | 0.97 |   0.88  |

## Gradient Boosting

| Accuracy | Precision | Recall |  F1  | ROC_AUC |
|----------|-----------|--------|------|---------|
|   0.94   |    0.95   |  0.98  | 0.96 |   0.91  |

As we can see the models more trustable are "Random Forest" and "Gradient Boosting", where the latter is slightly better, so we will choose this option. 

# Conclusions

According with the results of this project we can conclude the following:

* The probability of produce more defects in production increase if the production volume is above 800 pieces per day.
* If the maintenance hours per weeks are above 10 hours, the probability of produce defects in production increase.
* The most optimized model for the prediction of Manufacturing Defects is "Gradient Boosting".
